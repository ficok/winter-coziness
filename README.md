## Description
A dark, nord-like theme for VS Code.

I know the feeling when you find a theme that almost suits you, but some details bother you. That's why I'm providing you with the themes' `.json` file, so you can change it to your liking.

## Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/ficok/winter-coziness`
2. Open VS Code > Extensions
3. Drag the newest `.vsix` file into the Extensions
4. Reload VS Code

Alternatively, just move the whole folder into your `.vscode/extensions` folder. <br>
***Note:*** this sometimes doesn't work for me and I don't know why. The first method never failed me though.

Like my font? Check my [font repository](https://github.com/ficok/fonts) out. The font in the picture is 'regular-mono-v2'.

## To-do
- Terminal colors
- Git colors
